 Contribution: Added Login Page to Aethera AI Project  

🧩 Description:  
A responsive and user-friendly **Login Page** was added to enhance user authentication. This update includes:

- `login.html` – structure of the login interface  
- `login.css` – styling the login form and layout  
- `login.js` – handling validation and user interactions  

This marks a foundational step in securing Aethera AI and preparing it for user-based features.
